I did a quick speed comparison and it was considerably faster than print(..., file=f) when performing a large number of writes. On average write finished in 2.45s on my machine, whereas print took about 4 times as long (9.76s). That being said, in most real-world scenarios this will not be an issue. If you choose to go with print(..., file=f) you will probably find that you'll want to suppress the newline from time to time, or replace it with something else. This can be done by setting the optional end parameter, e.g.; Whichever way you choose I'd suggest using with since it makes the code much easier to read. Update: This difference in performance is explained by the fact that write is highly buffered and returns before any writes to disk actually take place (see this answer), whereas print (probably) uses line buffering. A simple test for this would be to check performance for long writes as well, where the disadvantages (in terms of speed) for line buffering would be less pronounced. The performance difference now becomes much less pronounced, with an average time of 2.20s for write and 3.10s for print. If you need to concatenate a bunch of strings to get this loooong line performance will suffer, so use-cases where print would be more efficient are a bit rare.",

        "content": "I end up wanting to do this fairly often when doing stuff from the shell.  It doesn't end up being more compact, and in many cases it's easier to just write a multi-line shell command than to write everything as a lambda.  You pretty much can't use any Python statement that ends with a colon.  So you end up having to write any for-like code as a genexp or list comprehension.  I Do this anyway for most stuff, but it's annoying to have to import sys and push everything to sys.stdout.writelines in cases where you could otherwise just write lambdas instead of function definitions.  This is often workable and has the useful side effect of forcing you to write very directed functions that really only do one thing.  However, it's not particularly convenient, and doesn't work for anything that mutates a value (e.g., dict.update) and then returns some element. Do not bother doing things properly with context managers Do not do any exception handling. Use a dictionary of lambdas instead of any if/else sections. Use type(name, bases, dict) to declare any classes.  This is pretty fun but only works if you happen to be declaring a class whose methods can all be expressed as lambdas. So for some things it works out but generally it's a big hassle, because you end up having to use a functional style that Python doesn't really support.  Most of the time I just write multiline shell commands like The $' is a bash quoting syntax, an alternative to its '...' and \"...\" quoting constructs.  It's useful, because it works like '...', but let’s you escape contained ' characters with \\'.  You can also embed newlines, so the above code could also be written as python -c $'import some_module\\nfor v in some_module.whatever():\\n    print \"Whatever: \\'{0}\\'\".format(v)'.  However, this is something of an acquired taste. One annoying thing about writing multiline commands in bash is that HOME and END go to the beginning of the command rather than the beginning of the line.  There may be a better way to do this, but I usually just scan back and forth by holding down CTRL and the left/right arrow keys.  Some Emacs user could probably set me straight here, since that's where bash's normal key bindings come from. If you want to insert a line break while editing a multiline command, you can do this with ^V-^J.  That will put in a line break in such a way that you can still scan back to the previous lines, rather than using the setup that you get otherwise, where you can't get back to the previous lines. The trick with ^V-^J works in IPython too, making it useful for editing class or function definitions.  It may also work in the basic Python REPL (probably); I just don't know, because I nearly always use IPython.",

Example of implicit line continuation: On the topic of line breaks around a binary operator, it goes on to say: For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators.\nBut this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is moved away from its operand and onto the previous line. In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code Knuth's style (line breaks before the operator) is suggested. Example of explicit line continuation:",
