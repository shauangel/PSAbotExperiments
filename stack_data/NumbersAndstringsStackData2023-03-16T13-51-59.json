There does seem to be a lot of regexp hate towards these answers which I think is unjustified, regexps can be reasonably clean and correct and fast.  It really depends on what you're trying to do.  The original question was how can you \"check if a string can be represented as a number (float)\" (as per your title).  Presumably you would want to use the numeric/float value once you've checked that it's valid, in which case your try/except makes a lot of sense.  But if, for some reason, you just want to validate that a string is a number then a regex also works fine, but it's hard to get correct.  I think most of the regex answers so far, for example, do not properly parse strings without an integer part (such as \".7\") which is a float as far as python is concerned.  And that's slightly tricky to check for in a single regex where the fractional portion is not required.  I've included two regex to show this. It does raise the interesting question as to what a \"number\" is.  Do you include \"inf\" which is valid as a float in python?  Or do you include numbers that are \"numbers\" but maybe can't be represented in python (such as numbers that are larger than the float max). There's also ambiguities in how you parse numbers.  For example, what about \"--20\"?  Is this a \"number\"?  Is this a legal way to represent \"20\"?  Python will let you do \"var = --20\" and set it to 20 (though really this is because it treats it as an expression), but float(\"--20\") does not work. Anyways, without more info, here's a regex that I believe covers all the ints and floats as python parses them.

I'll save the analysis of which solution is better for another thread.

Code DONT DO THIS Explanation Characters are essentially bytes: they can be encoded in different ways, but ultimately you can treat them within a given encoding as a sequence of bytes. In order to convert them to a number, we can shift them left 8-bits for their position in the sequence, creating a unique number. r, the range value, is the position in reverse order: the 4th element needs to go left 24 bytes (3*8), etc. After getting the range and converting our data to 8-bit integers, we can then transform the data and take the sum, giving us our unique identifier. It will be identical byte-wise (or in reverse byte-order) of the original number, but just \"as a number\". This is entirely futile. Don't do it. Performance Any performance is going to be outweighed by the fact that you're creating an identical object for no valid reason, but this solution is decently performant. 1,000 elements takes ~486 microseconds, 10,000 elements takes ~20.5 ms, while 100,000 elements takes about 1.5 seconds. It would work, but you shouldn't do it. This means it's scaled as O(n**2), which is likely due to memory overhead of reallocating the data each time the integer size gets larger. This might take ~4 hours to process all 8e6 elements (14365 seconds, calculated fitting the lower-order data to ax**2+bx+c). Remember, this is all to get the identical byte representation as the original data. Futility Remember, there are ~1e78 to 1e82 atoms in the entire universe, on current estimates. This is ~2^275.

For example, the find method requires searching through your string for the corresponding letter. A dictionary would be faster. Even faster might be (benchmark!) the chr function (if you're not too picky about the letter ordering) and the ord function to reverse the chr. But if you're not picky about ordering, it might be better if you just left-NULL-padded your string and treated it as a big binary number in memory if you don't need to display the value in any particular format. You might get some speedup by iterating over characters instead of character indices.

Two of the basic container data types in Python are the list and the dict. Using a list: List indexes are zero-based: Using a dict you can associate arbitrary numbers to strings: If the value is not present in the list, the index method will raise a ValueError exception. In Python it is common to surround this kind of expression with a try block (like commented by icktoofay): This programming style is very popular.
