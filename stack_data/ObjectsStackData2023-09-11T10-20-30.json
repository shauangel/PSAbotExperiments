Say that your method kk is used in multiple spots, and you don't want to have to send in some random variable to take up the spot of \"another_parameter\" shown below (working off of Christian's response), Personally, I think parameter lists should have ONLY what they need. So, as long as you have no need for the \"another_parameter\" variable that the bind() function sends, I suggest using Lambda by doing the following: I think you need the two parentheses after kk now because lambda is actually going to run that function with it's parameters (in your case, if you remove the one I said to, there would be none). What lambda is doing for us is catching the parameter being thrown to kk from the bind function (that is what the 'e' is after lambda, it represents the argument). Now, we don't need it in our parameter list, and we can resume our kk definition to be I started using the approach by Christian (which works!) but I didn't like the extra variable.
