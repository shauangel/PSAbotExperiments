Use a decorator to change the class and create the delegators, or using descriptors for the delegators.

Both can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dhilst/7435a09b4419da349bb4cc4ae855a451 with doctests :) -- Edit -- For anybody interested I made this a library: https://pypi.org/project/delegateto/ There were bugs in gist implementation, people contributed to this on github, the pypi project is updated, gist not. I strongly recommend you to use pypi version. Descriptors are things that can be getted and setted. In this case we are interested in the gettable ability of descriptors. The delegate descriptor defined like this And is used like this To call a descriptor simply call the method Foo('hello').upper(). Magic methods also works len(Foo('', [1,2,3,4])) returns 4. The gist link above has a more powerful implementation but the basics is the same. Everytime that you need to change a class behavior in an repetitive way, a decorator is a candidate. In this case the decorator will call setattr at the class to create the delegators. The usage is also simple, just decorate the class, as many times you want. The decorator will modify the class inplace so the same class is returned. Here is a usage And the call of the delegated method is also transparent Foo('hello').upper(). I prefer the second one because it seems more idiomatic for me. The decorator has an advantage to support multiple methods but this is implementable on the descriptor form too.
